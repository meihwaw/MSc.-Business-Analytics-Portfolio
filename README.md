An analysis on Whole Foods Market's digital product catalog that allowed customers to identify and purchase items according to their dietary preferences. The analysis dives into how the dietary preferences impacted the prices and the utilization of the whole foods diet preference that was created by the founder of Whole Foods Inc.

Insights summary:
A certain amount of dietary preferences attached to product (5 - 7 preferences) did increase the price of products especially for food products. It was a challenge to conclude for non-food products due to limited number of samples. This challenge raises the importance on placing dietary preferences on non-food products especially the vegan dietary preference because in a vegan lifestyle, the vegan dietary preference applies in both food and non-food. With the rise of vegan lifestyle adoption, it is important to ensure non-food products are also eqaually represented to ensure customers can make better purchase decisions.
